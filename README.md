# React + Vite

This application was spun up using Vite, meaning in order to run a local server you will use `npm run dev` instead of `npm start` as with `create-react-app`.

# Desktop / mobile image fader

## Goal
Make a react application that tracks some button clicks. Each button should track its own click count, and the header should display total clicks. There is a threshold variable that is defaulted to 10, but is changeable by the user. There is an image that fades in (using CSS opacity) when total button clicks reaches the set threshold.

## Mobile / desktop
Breakpoints at 480px. Mobile should display the header in fixed position with a drop shadow.

## Technology
React and CSS, using React hooks to track state. Break up UI into components as desired. Image should be Opacity 0 fading to opacity 1 when threshold is met.
